## Intro
`jx` is a custom Lisp interpreter implemented and designed to be easily embedded in Java.

## REPL
Launching the `.jar`-file without arguments starts a REPL.

```
$ java -jar jx.jar
jx v1

 1 (say 'hello)
 2
hello
```

## Performance
The core eval loop currently seems to run about as fast/slow as Python3.

### python
```
$ python3 benchmarks/run.py
```
```
fact 1.689405483
fib 0.634149815
```

### jx
```
$ java -jar jx.jar benchmarks/run.jx
```
```
fact 1.100314039S
fib 0.880710983S
```

## Branches
`if` may be used to conditionally evaluate a block of code.
```
(if T 1)
```
`1`

```
(if F 1)
```
`_`

`else` may be used to provide an alternative branch.
```
(if F 1 (else 2))
```
`2`

`else-if` may be used to reduce nesting.
```
(if F 1 (else-if F 2 3))
```
`3`

## Bindings
Values may be bound to identifiers at compile time using `var`.

```
(var foo 42)
foo
```
`42`

`let` may be used to create runtime bindings,

```
(let [foo 'bar]
  foo)
```
`'bar`

and locally override existing bindings.

```
(var foo 'foo)
foo
```
`'foo`

```
(^baz [] foo)
  
(let [foo 'bar] (baz))
```
`'bar`

```
foo
```
`'foo`

## Loops
`for` may be used to repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence.

```
(let [foo 0]
  (for [i [1 2 3]
    (inc foo i))
  (foo))
```
`6`

## Methods
Methods may be defined using `^`.

```
(^foo [x] Int 
  x)
  
(foo 42)
```
`42`

### Arguments
Methods may be made to accept a variable number of arguments by suffixing the final argument with `*`.
```
(^foo [x*] Int 
  (+ x*))
  
(foo 35 7)
```

Prefixing arguments with `'`, automatically quotes and passes the expression without evaluating at compile time.

```
(^foo [x] Int 
  x)
  
(foo (+ 35 7))
```
`42`

```
(^foo ['x] Expr 
  x)
  
(foo (+ 35 7))
```
`(+ 35 7)`

`,` may be used to unquote.
Note that this results in `(+ 35 7)` being spliced into `foo`'s body at compile time.
```
(^foo ['x] Expr ,x)

(foo (+ 35 7))
```
`42`

### Result
When a result type is specified, the value of the last evaluated form is returned;
otherwise Â´_`.
```
(^foo [x] _ 
  x)
  
(foo 42)
```
`_`

### Recalling
`recall` may be used to jump to the start of the current method.
```
(^fib [n a b] Int
  (if (> n 1) 
    (recall (- n 1) b (+ a b)) 
    (if (is n 0) a b)))

(fib 10 0 1)
```
`55`

### Exiting
`return` exits the current method after evaluating its arguments.

```
(^foo [] Int 1 (return 2 3) 4)
(foo)
```
`3`

### Macros
There is no special support for macros, quoted arguments + inlined direct calls = macros.

The following example implements `else-if` in user code.

Note that this would result in a compile error without quoted arguments,
since `else` is only defined inside `if`'s body.
```
(^my-else-if ['cond 'body*] Any
    (else (if ,cond ,body*)))

(if F (my-else-if T 42))
```
`42`

## IO
`say` prints its arguments followed by newline to standard output.
```
(say "35+7=" (+ 35 7))
```
```
35+7=42
```

## Quoting
Any expression may be quoted using `'`.
```
'(+ 1 2)
```
`'(+ 1 2)`

A quoted list becomes a list of quoted items.
```
'[foo bar baz]
```
`['foo 'bar 'baz]`

`,` may be used to unquote an expression.
```
(let [foo '(+ 1 2)]
  ,foo)
```
`3`

## Tests
`check` may be used to validate that a block of code produces the expected value.
```
(check 1 2)
```
```
Error in REPL@1:1: Check failed; expected 1, actual: 2
```

When called with one argument, the expected value is assumed to be `T`.
```
(check (= 42 42))
```
